# Evidence Cards

Evidence cards are the public share unit for ClaimBound results.

Each card is a compact JSON record that points to:

- the frozen protocol;
- the public source boundary;
- the sanitized result artifact;
- the exact result status;
- the claim boundary;
- the reproduction level.

The SVG preview is rendered from the JSON card. Do not edit rendered SVG cards
by hand after the result is known.

## Color Semantics

Color is a reading aid, not a second result system.

| Visual color | Used for | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Green | `PASSED_UNDER_PROTOCOL`, `REPRODUCED_OUTCOME`, `GREEN_VALIDATED` | The narrow card or validation gate passed. |
| Yellow | `REPRODUCED_OUTCOME_WITH_SOURCE_BYTE_DRIFT`, limited reproducibility | The outcome is useful, but reproduction has an important limitation. |
| Amber | `BLOCKED_SOURCE`, `INSUFFICIENT_COVERAGE` | No empirical success or failure should be claimed. |
| Red | `NEGATIVE_RESULT_UNDER_PROTOCOL` or invalid/tamper states | The protocol ran and the claim did not pass, or the card is invalid. |
| Gray | Drafts, requests and scaffolds | Not evidence yet. |

## What The Mix Shows

The current registry contains positive, negative, blocked and limited
reproduction outcomes. That is intentional:

- green cards show that a narrow public source or result passed;
- red cards show that a claim can fail honestly under fixed rules;
- amber cards show that a source was not good enough for a fair result;
- yellow drift cards show why reproduction needs exact source-boundary notes.

This makes the project more credible than a repository that publishes only
successful outcomes.

## Registry

The public registry index is
[docs/registry/evidence_index.json](../registry/evidence_index.json).

The registry is intended to remain freely readable. It stores card metadata and
aggregate statistics, not raw payloads.
